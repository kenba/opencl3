//! API.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! This crate provides a relatively simple, object based model of the OpenCL 3.0
//! [API](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_API.html).  
//! It is built upon the [cl3](https://crates.io/crates/cl3) crate, which
//! provides a functional interface to the OpenCL API.  
//!
//! **OpenCL** (Open Computing Language) is framework for general purpose
//! parallel programming across heterogeneous devices including: CPUs, GPUs,
//! DSPs, FPGAs and other processors or hardware accelerators.
//!
//! It is often considered as an open-source alternative to Nvidia's proprietary
//! Compute Unified Device Architecture [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone)
//! for performing General-purpose computing on GPUs, see
//! [GPGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units).
//!
//! The [OpenCL Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_API.html#_the_opencl_architecture)
//! has evolved over time and not all device vendors support all OpenCL features.
//!
//! [OpenCL 3.0](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_API.html)
//! is a unified specification that adds little new functionality to previous OpenCL versions.  
//! It specifies that all **OpenCL 1.2** features are **mandatory**, while all
//! OpenCL 2.x and OpenCL 3.0 features are now optional.
//!
//! See [OpenCL Description](https://github.com/kenba/opencl3/blob/main/docs/opencl_description.md).
//!
//! # OpenCL Architecture
//!
//! The [OpenCL Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_API.html#_the_opencl_architecture)
//! considers OpenCL as four models:
//!
//! * **Platform Model**  
//!   The physical OpenCL hardware: a *host* containing one or more OpenCL [platform]s,
//!   each connected to one or more OpenCL [device]s.  
//!   An OpenCL application running on the *host*, creates an OpenCL environment
//!   called a [context] on a single [platform] to process data on one or more
//!   of the OpenCL [device]s connected to the [platform].
//!
//! * **Programming Model**  
//!   An OpenCL [program] consists of OpenCL [kernel] functions that can run
//!   on OpenCL [device]s within a [context].  
//!   OpenCL [program]s must be created (and most must be built) for a [context]
//!   before their OpenCL [kernel] functions can be created from them,
//!   the exception being "built-in" [kernel]s which don't need to be built
//!   (or compiled and linked).  
//!   OpenCL [kernel]s are controlled by an OpenCL application that runs on the
//!   *host*, see **Execution Model**.
//!
//! * **Memory Model**  
//!   **OpenCL 1.2** memory is divided into two fundamental memory regions:
//!   **host memory** and **device memory**.  
//!   OpenCL [kernel]s run on **device memory**; an OpenCL application must write
//!   **host memory** to **device memory** for OpenCL [kernel]s to process.
//!   An OpenCL application must also read results from **device memory** to
//!   **host memory** after a [kernel] has completed execution.  
//!   **OpenCL 2.0** shared virtual memory ([svm]) is shared between the host
//!   and device(s) and synchronised by OpenCL; eliminating the explicit transfer
//!   of memory between host and device(s) memory regions.
//!
//! * **Execution Model**  
//!   An OpenCL application creates at least one OpenCL [command_queue] for each
//!   OpenCL [device] (or *sub-device*) within it's OpenCL [context].  
//!   OpenCL [kernel] executions and **OpenCL 1.2** memory reads and writes are
//!   "enqueued" by the OpenCL application on each [command_queue].
//!   An application can wait for all "enqueued" commands to finish on a
//!   [command_queue] or it can wait for specific [event]s to complete.
//!   Normally [command_queue]s run commands in the order that they are given.
//!   However, [event]s can be used to execute [kernel]s out-of-order.
//!

//!
//! ## Platform Model
//!
//! The platform model has thee objects:
//! * [Platform]
//! * [Device]
//! * [Context]
//!
//! Of these three objects, the OpenCL [Context] is by *far* the most important.
//! Each application must create a [Context] from the most appropriate [Device]s
//! available on one of [Platform]s on the *host* system that the application
//! is running on.
//!
//! Most example OpenCL applications just choose the first available [Platform]
//! and [Device] for their [Context]. However, since many systems have multiple
//! platforms and devices, the first [Platform] and [Device] are unlikely to
//! provide the best performance.  
//! For example, on a system with an APU (combined CPU and GPU, e.g. Intel i7)
//! and a discrete graphics card (e.g. Nvidia GTX 1070) OpenCL may find the
//! either the integrated GPU or the GPU on the graphics card first.
//!
//! OpenCL applications often require the performance of discrete graphics cards
//! or specific OpenCL features, such as [svm] or double/half floating point
//! precision. In such cases, it is necessary to query the [Platform]s and
//! [Device]s to choose the most appropriate [Device]s for the application before
//! creating the [Context].
//!
//! The [Platform] and [Device] modules contain structures and methods to simplify
//! querying the host system [Platform]s and [Device]s to create a [Context].
//!
//! ## Programming Model
//!
//! The OpenCL programming model has two objects:
//! * [Program]
//! * [Kernel]
//!
//! OpenCL [Kernel] functions are contained in OpenCL [Program]s.  
//!
//! Kernels are usually defined as functions in OpenCL [Program] source code,
//! however OpenCL [Device]s may contain built-in [Kernel]s,
//! e.g.: some Intel GPUs have built-in motion estimation kernels.
//!
//! OpenCL [Program] objects can be created from OpenCL source code,
//! built-in kernels, binaries and intermediate language binaries.
//! Depending upon how an OpenCL [Program] object was created, it may need to
//! be built (or complied and linked) before the [Kernel]s in them can be
//! created.
//!
//! All the [Kernel]s in an [Program] can be created together or they can be
//! created individually, by name.
//!
//! ## Memory Model
//!
//! The OpenCL memory model consists of five objects:
//! * [Buffer]
//! * [Image]
//! * [Sampler]
//! * [SvmVec]
//! * [Pipe]
//!
//! [Buffer], [Image] and [Sampler] are OpenCL 1.2 (i.e. **mandatory**) objects,  
//! [svm] and [Pipe] are are OpenCL 2.0 (i.e. optional) objects.
//!
//! A [Buffer] is a contiguous block of memory used for general purpose data.  
//! An [Image] holds data for one, two or three dimensional images.  
//! A [Sampler] describes how a [Kernel] is to sample an [Image], see
//! [Sampler objects](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_API.html#_sampler_objects).  
//!
//! [Shared Virtual Memory](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_API.html#shared-virtual-memory)
//! enables the host and kernels executing on devices to directly share data
//! without explicitly transferring it.
//!
//! [Pipes](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_API.html#_pipes)
//! store memory as FIFOs between [Kernel]s. [Pipe]s are not accessible from the host.
//!
//! ## Execution Model
//!
//! The OpenCL execution model has two objects:
//! * [CommandQueue]
//! * [Event]
//!
//! OpenCL commands to transfer memory and execute kernels on devices are
//! performed via [CommandQueue]s.
//!
//! Each OpenCL device (and sub-device) must have at least one command_queue
//! associated with it, so that commands may be enqueued on to the device.
//!
//! There are several OpenCL [CommandQueue] "enqueue_" methods to transfer
//! data between host and device memory, map SVM memory and execute kernels.
//! All the "enqueue_" methods accept an event_wait_list parameter and return
//! an [Event] that can be used to monitor and control *out-of-order* execution
//! of kernels on a [CommandQueue], see
//! [Event Objects](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_API.html#event-objects).
